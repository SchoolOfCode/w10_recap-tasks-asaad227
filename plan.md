Plan blogs----
Dummy artilces will be break into two articles 
1. Pigeon Facts
2. Pigeon History

both will have active comments section so visitor can leave their comments

first of all breaking down the components----
App-----will have Articles one and Articles two

Each articles will break down to 3 section 
 ---titles
 ---Paragraphs
 ---ListItem
 ---Form submit for comment section 
 ---Button 

 so components will need Form and ListItem. As only have 2 titles and couple of paragraphs 
 it will not create any components. I will display directly through mapping.

 all the componets folder will have styles.module.css file 


Pages plan----

Home page----
2nd page- Pigeon Facts with comments section extra features, section likes and dislike buttons.
3rd page- Pigeon History with comments section extra features, section likes and dislike
buttons.

Page 2nd and 3rd will have Nav bar Home---Pigeon Facts---Pigeon History

Home Page will have two card Pigeon Facts and Pigeon History
